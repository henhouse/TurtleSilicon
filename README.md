A user-friendly launcher for Turtle WoW on Apple Silicon Macs, with one-click patching of winerosetta, rosettax87 and d9vk.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   A working version of **CrossOver** installed (the trial version is sufficient and can still be used after expiration).
    - I recommend using CrossOver v25.0.1 or later. Older versions will cause issues.
*   The **Turtle WoW Client** downloaded from the official website.

## Credits

All credit for the core translation layer `winerosetta` and `rosettax87` goes to [**@Lifeisawful**](https://github.com/Lifeisawful). This application is merely a Fyne-based GUI wrapper to simplify the patching and launching process.

## Features

*   **Apple Silicon Compatibility:** Runs 32-bit DirectX9 World of Warcraft (v1.12) on M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs without "illegal instruction" errors.
*   **Performance Optimization:** 
    *   Integrates `rosettax87` for accelerated x87 FPU instructions
    *   Uses `d9vk` for efficient DirectX9 via Vulkan/Metal translation
    *   Achieves significant FPS improvements (20 FPS â†’ 200+ FPS in many scenarios)
*   **Vanilla-Tweaks Support:** Optional integration with automatic application.
*   **Automated Setup:** One-click patching for both CrossOver and Turtle WoW installations.
*   **Simple Interface:** Easy to use GUI with status indicators and configuration options.

## Usage

### Method 1: Using the Pre-built Application

1.  Launch `TurtleSilicon.app`.
     * (The app is not signed, so you will get a "this app is damaged" message. Open Terminal and enter `xattr -cr /Applications/TurtleSilicon.app` to bypass it)
3.  **Set CrossOver Path**:
    *   If CrossOver is installed in the default location (`/Applications/CrossOver.app`), this path will be pre-filled.
    *   Otherwise, click "Set/Change" and navigate to your `CrossOver.app` bundle.
4.  **Set TurtleWoW Directory Path**:
    *   Click "Set/Change" and select the folder where you have your Turtle WoW client files.
5.  **Apply Patches**:
    *   Click "Patch TurtleWoW".
    *   Click "Patch CrossOver".
    *   Status indicators will turn green once patching is successful for each.
6.  **Start RosettaX87 Service**:
    *   Click "Start RosettaX87 Service" and enter your sudo password when prompted.
    *   This will run the RosettaX87 service in the background and is required for launching the game.
    *   The service will automatically stop when you close the launcher.
7.  **Configure Options (Optional)**:
    *   **Enable vanilla-tweaks**: Check this box to use vanilla-tweaks, which provides various game improvements and fixes.
    *   If vanilla-tweaks hasn't been applied yet, TurtleSilicon will automatically offer to apply it when you launch the game.
    *   **Enable Metal Hud**: Shows FPS counter in-game.
    *   **Show Terminal**: Displays terminal output during game launch for debugging.
8.  **Launch Game**:
    *   Once both paths are set, both components are patched, and the RosettaX87 service is running, the "Launch Game" button will become active. Click it.
9.  **Enjoy**: Experience a significantly smoother Turtle WoW on your Apple Silicon Mac!

### Method 2: Running from Source Code

If you prefer to run the application directly from source code:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tairasu/TurtleSilicon.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```sh
    cd TurtleSilicon
    ```

3.  **Run the application**:
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```
    
    Note: This method requires Go to be installed on your system. See the Build Instructions section for details on installing Go and Fyne.

4.  **Use the application** as described in Method 1 (steps 2-6).

## Recommended settings

1. Set "Terrain distance" as low as possible. This reduces the overhead stress on the CPU
2. Turn Vertex Animation Shaders on. Otherwise you get graphic glitches on custom models.
3. Set Multisampling to 24-bit color 24-bit depth **2x** to make portraits load
4. Add `SET shadowLOD "0"` to your Config.wtf inside the WTF directory

## Build Instructions

To build this application yourself, you will need:

1.  **Go**: Make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/).
2.  **Fyne**: Install the Fyne toolkit and its dependencies by following the instructions on the [Fyne website](https://developer.fyne.io/started/).

Once Go and Fyne are set up, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to build the application for Apple Silicon (ARM64) macOS:

### Option 1: Using the Makefile (Recommended)

The included Makefile automates the build process and handles copying the required resource files:

```sh
make
```

This will:
1. Build the application for Apple Silicon macOS
2. Automatically copy the rosettax87 and winerosetta directories to the app bundle

### Option 2: Manual Build

If you prefer to build manually:

```sh
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 fyne package
# Then manually copy the resource directories
cp -R rosettax87 winerosetta TurtleSilicon.app/Contents/Resources/
```

In either case, this will create a `TurtleSilicon.app` file in the project directory, which you can then run.

Make sure you have an `Icon.png` file in the root of the project directory before building.

## Bundled Binaries

The `rosettax87` and `winerosetta` components included in this application are precompiled for convenience. If you prefer, you can compile them yourself by following the instructions provided by Lifeisawful on the official repositories:
